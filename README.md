# Chrome Extension: Force New Tabs to Main Window

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/timtrinidad/chrome-extension-force-new-tabs-to-main-window.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/timtrinidad/chrome-extension-force-new-tabs-to-main-window)

This is a simple chrome extension that allows you to designate
a single main window to which new tabs are opened.

For example, you may want one window to only be your mail client (e.g. gmail),
but still want your main browsing window to handle any new tabs opened from an email.

## Usage
1. Install the extension
2. Open the extension options
3. Choose a window in which all new tabs should be opened.
