# Chrome Extension: Force New Tabs to Main Window
This is a simple chrome extension that allows you to designate
a single main window to which new tabs are opened.

For example, you may want one window to only be your mail client (e.g. gmail),
but still want your main browsing window to handle any new tabs opened from an email.
